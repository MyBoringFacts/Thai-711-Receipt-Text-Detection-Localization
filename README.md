# Receipt Text Detection Pipeline

This project detects text regions on receipt images using YOLO.  
The dataset was manually collected, labeled in Azure, and converted to YOLO format for training.

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates a mini data engineering pipeline for computer vision:
- Data collection and labeling
- Label conversion from Azure format → YOLO
- Preprocessing and batch preparation
- Model training and visualization of detected text blocks

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python, OpenCV, Pandas
- Azure Custom Vision
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- LabelMe
- Jupyter Notebooks
